# Linear Ordering and Cluster Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Linear Ordering and Cluster Analysis project! This project focuses on two main components: linear ordering implemented in Python and cluster analysis conducted in R. The objective is to provide a comprehensive solution for organizing data linearly and analyzing clusters effectively. Additionally, a detailed analysis report in Polish is included as a PDF file.

## Linear Ordering (Python)

The linear ordering component is implemented in Python, using a modular structure for clarity and ease of use. To explore the implementation details, refer to the `linear_ordering.py` file.

### How to Use the Python Component

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Open the `linear_ordering.py` file to understand the code structure and functionalities.
3. Customize the code according to your data or requirements.
4. Run the Python script to perform linear ordering on your dataset.

## Cluster Analysis (R)

The cluster analysis is conducted in R, providing a robust approach to understanding patterns within the data.

### How to Use the R Component

1. Make sure you have R installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the R code file, and explore `cluster_analysis.R` for implementation details.
3. Modify the R code as needed for your specific dataset or analysis requirements.
4. Execute the R script to conduct cluster analysis on your data.

## Analysis Report (Polish)

The analysis report, available as a PDF file (`analysis_report.pdf`), offers a detailed examination of the study's findings. Please note that the report is presented in the Polish language.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or encounter issues. Happy analyzing!
